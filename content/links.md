Here's a collection of interesting stuff I've found. 

## Politics and the Tech Industry
- [Molleindustria](https://molleindustria.org/) They have some fun games about leftist politics
  - [The Big Data Manifesto](https://molleindustria.org/files/BIG-DATA.html) "If you have serious ideas about life, if you make artistic discoveries and if all of a sudden your head begins to crackle with laughter, If you find all your ideas useless and ridiculous, know that IT IS BIG DATA BEGINNING TO SPEAK TO YOU"
- [Our Comrade The Electron](https://idlewords.com/talks/our_comrade_the_electron.html) "The electrons don't care"
- [The Chips of Our Lives](https://processedworld.com/Issues/issue10/i10chips1.htm) "They gripe about roving squads of security guards who randomly enter unoccupied offices to check for papers left on desktops. Too many "finds" get IBM engineers in trouble."
