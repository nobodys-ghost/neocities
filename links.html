    Ever wondered what happens when you type a <abbr>URL</abbr> into your
    browser? Here's an <em>exhaustive</em> list.

  <h2>Assorted Things</h2>
  <p>Stuff that I couldn't think of a better category for</p>
  <h3>
    <a href="https://eldritchdata.neocities.org/">Eldritch Data Vault</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    There's some interesting stuff on here. Like a guide on how to make black
    powder and some Magic the Gathering deck lists.

  <h3>
    <a href="https://rotatingsandwiches.com/">Rotating Sandwiches</a>
  </h3>
  <p>That's it.</p>

      >TIME CUBE</a
    >
  </h3>

  <p>
    I felt like I had to include this because the Wikipedia article for Time
    Cube was one of my first exposures to the indie web. And when I found a link
    to this site in the wild, it was like I met a celebrity.
