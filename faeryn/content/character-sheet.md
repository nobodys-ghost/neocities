## Abilities

### Back door

*You throw open a door and lunge through it into a twisted metallic nightmare: home.*

Once per session, you can find an entrance to the Vault no matter where you are in Spire. (Whether it was there before you started looking remains unclear.) Inside, you’ll find a collection of strange items and peculiar books, many of which relate to or come from alternate histories, and some of which tell the truth. Any non-Sage character who enters the Vault should roll Resist+Occult or suffer Mind stress.

### The Vault

*You have access to the vast informational resources of the sages.*

While inside the Vault, you have access to equipment that will allow you to perform an Investigate check on any subject. It won’t confer mastery, but it will allow you to perform the check.

### Obsessive Researcher

*You spend every quiet moment filling your brain with knowledge — knowledge which is often fleeting.*

At the start of each session, gain a knack of you choosing in any skill or domain, even if you don’t normally have access to it. At the end of the session, you lose that knack. You can’t have the same knack two sessions in a row; you get bored, and must expand your mind in different ways.

## Bonds

### Kovach (he/him)

I know that he lies about his durance, and that he actually chose to be a duelist.

### Cas (she/her)

One of the academics Faeryn studied with during their initation. Has continued to help Faeryn out as needed, in exchange for the occasional favor. They’ve all been research related so far…
