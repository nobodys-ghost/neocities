# Welcome
Spire is a tabletop role playing game, where you play as Drow trying to overthrow the oppressive Aelfir society. My friends and I are starting a campaign soon, so I wanted a handy place to store my character information. This portion of the site has my character’s information and backstory, and I’d like to expand it as the game goes on.

## Content Warnings
This section of the site contains mentions of indentured servitude, forced consent, scarification, and dehumanization. 

If you’re under 14, I’d proceed with caution. There are some mature themes here.
