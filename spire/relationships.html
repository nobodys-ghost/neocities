            Leaves owns an opera house, and he's very connected in the art
            world. He's been doing scarification for a while, but Faeryn is his
            first living art project. They were a bit of an impulse purchase.
            He'd been looking to replace his last administrative assistant, but
            Faeryn caught his eye. He had only just become stilled enough
            consider such a large scale project. He's outgoing and charismatic,
            with some Machiavellian tendencies. He cycles through several low -
            moderate commitment romantic relationships, usually maintaining
            multiple at a time.

            Kovach and Faeryn briefly met during their respective durances.
            Leaves would go to the dueling arena from time to time, and brought
            Faeryn with him to show off. Leaves and Kovach's master were in a
            loose relationship, and they'd flirt and talk about high society
            while watching the duels. During one of these conversations,
            Kovach's master shared that Kovach had willingly joined the Bound,
            and had actively seeked out a durance as a duelist. Though Faeryn
            and Kovach were left alone in Leaves's private box a few times, they
            never spoke. Faeryn was under orders to not move or speak, and they
            took it seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kovach and Faeryn would meet again, once Faeryn was a few months out
            of their durance. Kovach was acting as a vigilante, and killed
            Faeryn's dealer. Faeryn tracked him down to a bar later that night,
            and the two went on a mini quest to recover the drugs from the
            dealer's body, which sat at the bottom of a hundred story drop.

            Aster is Faeryn's occasional smoking buddy. He grew up in high
            society, but is estranged from his parents. He originally moved to
            Ivory Circle on his parent's money, but during his first year there,
            he came to two important realizations. The first was that the Drow
            don't deserve to be subjugated and treated as an underclass, and he
            wanted to use his art as political activism. Shortly after, he came
            to the second realization: none of the artists he was surrounded by
            had any interest in doing anything with their art beyond making it
            and funding their bohiemian lifestyle. Now he's living in middle
            city to afford his bills while making a name for himself painting.
            He's pretty progressive for an Aelfir. He doesn't ipathize with the
            Drow experience of oppression, but he intellectually understands
            it's bad. He and Faeryn like to make fun of Aelfir high society
            together.

            Aster and Faeryn met at a small theater show of a play Faeryn had
            found in the Vermissian. Aster vaguely knew the director, and
            correctly predicted the production would be artistically vapid. He
            struck up a conversation during intermission, and they ditched the
            second act.

            Cas is a Vermissian Sage and ministry operative. She first alerted
            the ministry to Faeryn's research, and Faeryn studied with her
            during their initiation. Cas works for the fire department, tracking
            down people who would start fires in alternate timelines and killing
            them before they can damage her native Spire.
