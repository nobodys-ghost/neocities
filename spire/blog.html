          <p>Today has been...a lot so far.</p>
          <p>
            I got summoned by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon last night, so I barely had
            enough time to meet up with Red this morning. Which, apparently
            she's raising her prices? Ugh. She said some new people have been
            moving into town. Which sucks. Thankfully it didn't cut into my
            finances too much but if this keeps up I might have to do something
            about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways. I was barely not late to meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon. He
            told Kovach and I that someone the Ministry has been paying off in
            the city guard named Captain Garris stopped replying to them about
            two weeks ago, and we were asked to "resolve the matter." Whatever
            that means. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon did tell us that he wasn't the
            only person in the guard on their payroll, so if something were to
            happen to <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Garris it wouldn't be the end of the
            world. Which, good thing, seeing how things turned out.

            You'd think that after a chaotic morning, I might get a break. I was
            just hoping it would last a bit longer than an afternoon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pretty much as soon as I finished writing my last entry, Kovach left
            to go get in touch with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon, and I got to take
            off to the Vermissian. I found an entrance to the vault pretty
            easily, but it was in one of the pipe systems they used to use to
            contain water run off before they realized that trying to merge the
            subway with an Eldritch horror was a bad idea. And even though I
            knew the geometry would be fucky going in, I still managed to fall
            on my face. And worse, I messed up the cozy little reading nook that
            was in there. The splash from my fall ended up kicking up a lot of
            water. Thankfully, the books were alright, but the chair is fucked.
            And whoever visits next is going to know it was me because I signed
            the visitor log. Hopefully the pile of notes I left is enough to
            save some face.
