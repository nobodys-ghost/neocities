          Fuck me. I&apos;m fucking doomed. Because I&apos;m going to have to
          explain to Leaves why I&apos;m on his doorstep with no notice, and
          there&apos;s no way I&apos;m telling him the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          What actually happened: I got my vape back from the Vermissian and
          smoked a lot before I fell asleep. I honestly thought it was justified
          given the fucking day I was having but damn. Today&apos;s setting up to
          make that seem like nothing. So I woke up and had to go meet Kovach
          and Maewin, and I&apos;m still fucking high so I showed up at whatever
          that place Kovach lives above is called and <em>of course</em> he was
          already there. He got a letter from Mes. Simon and now we&apos;re
          supposed to be going to this gala. And Leave&apos;s name is circled on
          the invitation so he&apos;s important in whatever this whole scheme is.
        </p>
        <p>
          And fucking hell Maewin was already there too. Good to see her, glad
          she&apos;s okay, all of that stuff. I was worried for her last night.
          She talked to Ryanton and I guess now I kind of see what the people
          who tried to kidnap us might have meant when they said her “grand
          goals” were the same as the ministry&apos;s. She&apos;s trying to set up
          a pyramid scheme but I guess she&apos;s also trying to make some kind
          of change in Spire? But Maewin got to asking what Kovach and I were
          doing at that class and I didn&apos;t have a good answer and now she
          knows something&apos;s up.
        </p>
        <p>
          And fuck I <em>wish</em> I had a good answer for her. But what am I
          supposed to say? “Oh, we&apos;re just trying to figure out who ordered
          the assassination of the captain of the guard because he was on the
          take for our rebel organization?” I don&apos;t think so. “I have
          friends in high places and you asking questions would have
          consequences for me?” Telling someone they can&apos;t ask questions is
          just going to make them ask more questions. “You&apos;re really pretty,
          let&apos;s just fuck until you forget you were suspicious of me?” As if
          she&apos;d ever be into a fucking <em>art project</em>. Fuck. This is
          exactly why I keep to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m so sick of people judging me. First Mis. Dobbs, then Delta,
          now Maewin, I&apos;ll bet money Leaves is next but at least I&apos;m
          stuck with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least I got to fill in Kovach on everything that happened with
          Hemlock. But while we were talking I let it slip that I actually
          really wanted an excuse to meet Leaves, and I&apos;m just
          <em>hoping</em> that doesn&apos;t get addressed. Say what you will
          about the man, at least he foots the bill for my rent. And the ivory.
          As much as I whine, I&apos;d rather die than have him call it quits.
          He&apos;s actually a decent guy, I swear. He just hasn&apos;t thought
          through the implications of torture opera as a genre. And unlike
          everyone else, he actually gives a shit about what happens to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now I have to get information out of him and I have no idea how. I
          can ask if he has plans tonight because now I know he does. If he
          decides not to just tell me what&apos;s going on…I guess we&apos;ll
          figure it out. As if that&apos;s something I do well.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I&apos;m going to tell him: I split my shoulder open climbing out
          that damn window and that&apos;s as good a reason as any to need to see
          him. I&apos;ll just tell him I fell. That&apos;s not even a lie!
          Kovach… we&apos;ll figure it out. I&apos;m high as fuck and there&apos;s
          no way I can act 100% sober. If Kovach says he wanted to keep an eye
          on me, Leaves might buy it. I don&apos;t even think that&apos;s a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ll see if I can get Kovach on board. If not, I guess I have to
          wing it. Not like that&apos;s been going well for me so far. I just
          really can&apos;t let Leaves get wind that I want to overthrow the
          entire system that got him to where he is. Because then there goes my
          rent money and my life and my entire fucking purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay. Just stop thinking about it. Pull yourself together, Faeryn.
          Fuck. Remember what he told you. He made you what you are. He
          <em>promised</em> he&apos;d take care of you.
        </p>
        <p>Leaves made me what I am. He&apos;ll take care of me.</p>
        <p>Leaves made me what I am. He&apos;ll take care of me.</p>
        <p>Leaves made me what I am. He&apos;ll take care of me.</p>
