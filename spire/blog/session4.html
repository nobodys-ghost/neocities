          <h1>And Now There Are Demons</h1>
          <time datetime="2024-08-30">August 30, 2024</time>
        </header>
        <p>
          I don&apos;t know what I was expecting from this whole prayer circle
          thing, but it definitely wasn&apos;t <i>summoning demons</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maewyn met us outside and lent us some robes. When we walked inside,
          Ryanton called us all into a circle. She welcomed Maewin to the group,
          and we were brought in front of this dirty, yellow robe. Ryanton
          offhandedly mentioned it was an eidolon, and then…She said it was time
          to introduce Maewin to the Sleeping Smoke, and asked us all to join
          her in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve heard of eidolons before, once. Leaves offhandedly mentioned
          them, and I fell down a rabbit hole of reading. Eidolons hold the
          essence of a demon, used in demon summoning. And I guess this one held
          the Sleeping Smoke, and we were all about to pray to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow smoke started filling the space, and then I was alone. This
          raspy voice asked if I had anything to offer it, and I know I had
          something, but I don&apos;t remember what it is anymore. There was
          just smoke, and then it talking to me, and then I was back in the room
          with everyone else. It&apos;s been freaking me out a little bit.
          It&apos;s like when I&apos;ve gotten too high, but instead of
          everything being fuzzy, there&apos;s this one thing that&apos;s
          just…not there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maewin was still out of it, and I was starting to get worried about
          her. And then…it spoke. <em>Through her.</em> To Ryanton. It said was
          good to talk again, and it mentioned their “grand goals” that are
          going to be happening in a couple days. My blood ran cold as soon as I
          heard that. I know a bit about demons, but I don&apos;t know anything
          about how summoning them works. And for a good reason. The
          <del>most successful</del> least destructive summonings can level a
          city block. The bad ones could level an entire neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least Maewin was okay, even if she did seem a bit out of it.
          Apparently the demon spoke to her and told her she was special. And
          that has me so worried. She doesn&apos;t seem like she knows what
          she&apos;s getting herself into. She said that Ryanton wanted to talk
          with her after the whole demon things, so I invited her to come meet
          Kovach and I at that tea place tomorrow and fill us in on the
          conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we talking, some people were scraping up the residue the smoke
          left on the walls. Unrefined sulfur. And I noticed a flash of red
          clothes under one of their robes. I guess I shouldn&apos;t be
          surprised the Redcloaks are in on this. Sulfur sells for a high price.
          Maybe that&apos;s why Garris was involved with Ryanton&apos;s class.
          He could have been investigating the Redcloaks and hoping to score an
          invitation to this prayer scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kovach came over to chat with Maewin and asked her if she knew
          anything about a gala that was happening in a couple days. She
          didn&apos;t seem to, and I left them to follow the Redcloaks out.
          They&apos;re refining sulfur, and I&apos;m meeting them at the Old
          Well tomorrow to pick it up. Which means I&apos;ll have to scrape
          together some cash between now and then, but I think I can manage it.
          They offered to give me a discount since I told them I was new in
          town. Kind of shady, honestly. I&apos;ve met dealers like that before.
          They give you a discount on your first purchase or two, and when
          you&apos;re hooked, you&apos;re suddenly paying full price. I guess I
          can&apos;t complain too much if I&apos;m saving money, but it&apos;s
          still scummy.
        </p>
        <p>
          They left, and Kovach and I started to talk through everything that
          happened. Kovach had no idea that any of that was at all demonic. I
          explained the whole thing with the eidolon and the sulfur residue, and
          I was about to try and talk him out of killing another dealer I was
          going to buy from when someone tried to
          <i>put bags over our heads</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, they succeeded. Kinda. They got the bags over our heads, and I
          stepped on one of the floor tiles that looked out of place. There used
          to be a Vermissian station that ran under the campus, and the basement
          we were in was part of it. That tile was part of the old station. And
          as soon as my foot hit the tile, I was back five seconds ago, but
          standing a foot to the left when they tried to bag me.
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn&apos;t mention they were ministry until I had my crossbow
          pointed at them, but at least then we could have a normal conversation
          about everything that happened. They&apos;d been looking into the cult
          for a while and didn&apos;t want us fucking up their plan, which is
          why they were going to bag us. Apparently the prayer group&apos;s
          “grand goals” are also the Ministry&apos;s goals, so I guess
          we&apos;re rolling with it. I still don&apos;t really see how
          summoning a demon helps the Ministry, but I kinda have to take their
          word for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          They knew a bit about what happened to Garris — apparently he&apos;d
          gotten too close to finding something and someone from Upspire had him
          assassinated. Sounds like it was one of the Redcloaks. I showed them
          the pendant we found on the assassin, and they confirmed it had to do
          with the Autumn Banquet. And they seemed pretty confused by it.
          Someone in the Banquet was pretty pissed to hear that Garris had died,
          and that&apos;s apparently not the norm when they openly assassinate
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          They&apos;ve also been looking into the cult, and told us to stay out
          of their hair. Easy enough. But they mentioned that we won&apos;t have
          to deal with Redcloak sulfur after tomorrow which…might be a small
          problem for me. I&apos;m supposed to be picking up the sulfur the day
          after tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that point, it was getting late, so Kovach and I went our separate
          ways. I needed to decompress, anyways. It feels like so long ago that
          I woke up to the guard kicking in my neighbor&apos;s door, but that
          was actually only fourteen hours ago. And fuck, I&apos;m so glad to be
          home. I downed a glass of whiskey when I got through the door and
          I&apos;m going to make some dinner soon. I might head back to the
          vault after I eat so I can vape and go over my notes from the lecture.
