          <h1>He Almost Jumped Out The Window, But That's Not How He Died</h1>

        <p>Today has been...a lot so far.</p>
        <p>
          I got summoned by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon last night, so I barely had
          enough time to meet up with Red this morning. Which, apparently she's
          raising her prices? Ugh. She said some new people have been moving
          into town. Which sucks. Thankfully it didn't cut into my finances too
          much but if this keeps up I might have to do something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways. I was barely not late to meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon. He
          told Kovach and I that someone the Ministry has been paying off in the
          city guard named Captain Garris stopped replying to them about two
          weeks ago, and we were asked to "resolve the matter." Whatever that
          means. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon did tell us that he wasn't the only
          person in the guard on their payroll, so if something were to happen
          to <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Garris it wouldn't be the end of the world.
          Which, good thing, seeing how things turned out.
        </p>
        <p>
          We went down to Perch to poke around at a bar he frequents, and the
          Crow Master told us he was renting a room upstairs. Something seemed
          up with her, but I imagine I'd probably seem pretty off if I spent all
          of my time around crows.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turned out to be a good thing that I've been learning to pick locks
          in my downtime, because it got us into his apartment. And uh, turns
          out he was home. I was really convinced he was going to be dead or
          away. And just about as soon as we walked in, Captain Garris tried to
          <em>jump out the fucking window.</em> Kovach tackled him, but I was
          too shocked by the fact we <em>just met this man</em> and he
          immediately tried to jump out the window to try and be of any help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kovach was really ready to slit his throat, and while I was trying to
          explain to him that hey, maybe we should ask this guy some questions
          first, someone <em>shot</em> Garris through the window. Of course,
          everyone panics, someone yells that we're calling the cops, so Kovach
          and I had to make a run for it. Even worse, we didn't get a chance to
          look around the room. And he had a whole conspiracy board he threw
          into the fire. I grabbed some stuff that didn't make it into the fire
          before we had to climb out the window that Garris just tried to jump
          out of.
        </p>
        <p>
          This <em>really</em> wasn't how I planned on spending my afternoon. My
          shoulder still hurts from last week and <em>of course</em> climbing
          out the window re-opened those cuts. At least my shirt didn't get too
          bloody.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we were on the ground, lo and behold, we see the guy who shot
          Garris. Kovach practically dragged me along while we chased him. We
          managed to catch up to him, and they actually landed a shot on Kovach.
          Thankfully he wasn't too badly hurt. It just grazed his shoulder.
          Well, Kovach wasn't hurt. This guy was definitely using a human gun,
          and it blew up in his hands. Flung him into a wall and I think he hit
          his head. Regardless, he's dead now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which meant we got to flee the scene of a second crime that we didn't
          even commit! Kovach found some kind of weird pendant on this guy's
          body that I didn't recognize, but it looks a lot like something you'd
          see in Amaranth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kovach's place was about an hour away, which was closer than mine, so
          we headed back there. (I'm also not entirely sure if I trust him
          enough to let him into my apartment anyways. And I don't need anyone
          else seeing the mess. There's a reason Aster is the only person I let
          visit.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, Kovach's place is...weird. He had a whole conspiracy board and
          everything. And a slightly alarming number of pieces of bloodstained
          paper. I asked about one and I guess it was a bill of sale from some
          Aelfir that sounded like they had it coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I finally got the chance to look at the papers I grabbed. They were
          definitely meant for the fire, but I'm not sure why. One of them was a
          sketch of some Drow wearing a red cloak, and the other was a syllabus
          for Introductory Prayer 102 at the Benevolent Order of Wisdom and
          Discovery. I'm really hoping we don't have to go there. Don't get me
          wrong, I don't have beef with the people who study there, but the
          whole place seems a bit...quaint. Not in a good way. But maybe I'm
          just being all superior because being self-taught isn't exactly a walk
          in the park. Neither is running around alternate timelines to find
          reports of fires, but I don't really think most places will teach you
          how to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had to tell Kovach how to put the pendant we found back together.
          Which at least gave the the chance to smoke. Let me tell you, ivory
          hits so much better at the end of a long day when you're sore and
          exhausted. But it's only early afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully the rest of today is going to be a little calmer. Kovach
          said he'd let <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon know that Garris is dead. I'm
          really hoping this counts as "resolving the matter." I'd prefer to
          avoid opening those cuts again. Hurt like a bitch but I don't think
          Kovach noticed.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least I have an excuse to hole up in the Vermissian for a while. I
          offered to take the pendant to the Vault and see if I could find any
          information on it. I kind of forgot how people who aren't used to
          being in the Vermissian think of it. Kovach was definitely suprised
          when I suggested going there. I guess it makes sense. The Vermissian
          does a number on people who aren't familiar with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sounds like the plan is that once I'm done writing this, he's going to
          go talk to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon and I'll go to the Vault. I wonder
          if I'll have to ask Cas for help. I'd rather not. Not like there's
          anything wrong with asking her, but I'd rather not bother her with
          pointless requests. And it would be a little embarrassing to ask since
          I spent <em>four whole years</em> living in Amaranth and I'm still
          going up there at least a few times a month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wonder when I'll hear from Leaves again. Hopefully he's not going to
          want to add more "decorations" to me any time soon. At least, it would
          be nice if it didn't happen until I'm done climbing out of windows.
