          <h1>Getting Woken Up By The Cops Is Not Fun</h1>

        <p>
          You&apos;d think that after a chaotic morning, I might get a break. I
          was just hoping it would last a bit longer than an afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretty much as soon as I finished writing my last entry, Kovach left
          to go get in touch with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon, and I got to take off
          to the Vermissian. I found an entrance to the vault pretty easily, but
          it was in one of the pipe systems they used to use to contain water
          run off before they realized that trying to merge the subway with an
          Eldritch horror was a bad idea. And even though I knew the geometry
          would be fucky going in, I still managed to fall on my face. And
          worse, I messed up the cozy little reading nook that was in there. The
          splash from my fall ended up kicking up a lot of water. Thankfully,
          the books were alright, but the chair is fucked. And whoever visits
          next is going to know it was me because I signed the visitor log.
          Hopefully the pile of notes I left is enough to save some face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I got kind of lucky. I definitely found one of the smaller
          vaults, but it still had a guide to Aelfir religious etiquette that
          were pretty useful. Definitely out of date and hard to decipher though
          all the weird allegory, but whatever. Turns out the pendant we found
          was a symbol of this thing called the Autumn Banquet. It has something
          to do with the worship of Brother Autumn. He&apos;s supposed to be the
          deity of death and closure. The Aelfir belief is that if something is
          coming to an end, it probably has to do with him. Or it used to be.
          It&apos;s been <i>out of fashion</i> for the last century to openly
          worship him.
        </p>
        <p>
          That book didn&apos;t go too much detail, but that&apos;s what the
          vault is for. It took some scrounging, but I found a book from around
          when the Aelfir originally took over about ritual mutilation as
          worship of Brother Autumn. It…was not a fun read. It went into way
          more detail than I needed. Most of it was on ritual amputation, but
          there was some stuff about scarification that I had to skip. The more
          I looked at those passages, the more it felt like Leaves was carving
          into my skin all over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least it had some relevant information. The author went on a
          tangent about some new (at the time of publishing), fringe methods of
          worship that they thought were noteworthy, stuff that had to do with
          removing concepts themselves from existence. And one of the groups
          they mentioned was the Autumn Banquet. The Autumn Banquet wasn&apos;t
          content to see the Drow languish in misery and squalor. So they&apos;d
          fund whatever well-intentioned Drow efforts to rebuild that looked
          like they were going to fail, just so the resulting failure was more
          spectacular.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a bunch of fucking scumbags. The Drow noble houses were forced to
          sign away the city. To go in and fund our efforts to rebuild, just so
          they can praise their gods when they fail spectacularly…makes me angry
          just writing about it. But shit like this is why I joined the
          Ministry. I&apos;m sick of playing nice with them and staying out of
          the way. Their fucking laws let someone rent me for four years and
          cover me with scars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shit. I don&apos;t want to think about this anymore. It&apos;s like I
          can feel his scalpel running down my arms all over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I left a stack of notes on what I&apos;d found under the research log.
          It doesn&apos;t fix the chair, but at least it&apos;s something.
          Besides, I think the chair is less important than the information. I
          hope someone comes to fix it eventually. That place <em>was</em> cozy.
          And then I fucked it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways. I went back to the…whatever the fuck that bar/tea shop Kovach
          likes is called. The one Gunther works at. It&apos;s been a long day
          and the name is completely escaping me. Kovach got there a little bit
          later and I filled him in on the whole Autumn Banquet thing. He let me
          know he&apos;d sent word to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon about the whole
          Garris thing, and we agreed to meet up at the Benevolent Order of
          Wisdom and Discovery in the morning. I still have no idea if Garris
          being dead counts as resolving the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          And after this morning, I&apos;m not optimistic. I woke up
          <em>way</em> earlier than I would have liked because people were
          yelling outside. Didn&apos;t recognize most of the voices, but one of
          them was Maji Dobbs. So I poked my head outside and got the
          <i>pleasure</i> of meeting Garris&apos;s replacement. Now-Captain
          Hemlock is going on a bit of a power trip, I think. Trying to make a
          name for himself by cracking down on petty crime. Which apparently
          translates into kicking my next door neighbor&apos;s door down at
          7:30am. (According to <abbr>Maj.</abbr> Dobbs, Greeves was kind of a
          piece of shit, so maybe he had it coming.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You can bet that the moment I see five guards standing in the hallway
          to my building, I got nervous. I remembered to bury my vape in my
          dirty laundry last night so it wouldn&apos;t be obvious at a glance,
          but that wouldn&apos;t help much if they tossed the place. And my
          heart fucking sank when one of them walked out of Greeves&apos;s place
          with a bag of shrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feels targeted. This isn&apos;t a rowdy part of town, but
          it&apos;s not exactly sober either. There&apos;s me, Greeves
          apparently does shrooms, and half the building does Malak. Including
          <abbr>Maj.</abbr> Dobbs. But it&apos;s not like any of us are here to
          cause trouble. I don&apos;t know where other people get their fix, but
          at least Red&apos;s just trying to make a living. And we barely ever
          have guards out here. I&apos;ve seen them exactly once since I moved
          in. Until this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had to do <em>something</em> to get Hemlock to fuck off. If he was
          to go into my place, the ivory alone could get me locked up. It&apos;s
          not like I leave ministry stuff lying around, but our Hidden Mistress
          only knows what a scummy guard with sufficient motivation could put
          together. So…I brought up Leaves. Of course Hemlock didn&apos;t know
          who I was talking about. So I had to explain to him as monosyllabicaly
          as possible that there&apos;s a very well connected Aelfir who might
          have some <i>opinions</i> on his pet getting dragged away. Thankfully,
          a couple of the guards knew of Leaves and one said that I probably
          wasn&apos;t worth the trouble. And Hemlock agreed as bitterly as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          They fucked off after that, and I got to have an
          <em>awkward</em> exchange with Maj. Dobbs. She definitely seemed
          thankful that the guards left us alone, but I can tell she knows that
          something&apos;s up with me. And I think she knows it&apos;s more than
          just the drugs. I&apos;m really hoping I don&apos;t have to find a new
          apartment soon. If all else fails, maybe I can hole up with Aster for
          a while. And if <em>that</em> fails, Leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m not super thrilled that I had to bring Leaves into this mess.
          I hope it doesn&apos;t get back to him. Worst case, I can tell him
          that I was using and that I needed a way to get the Guard off my back.
          Doesn&apos;t imply I&apos;ve been involved with the Ministry, and
          it&apos;s not like Leaves couldn&apos;t reasonably know I&apos;ve been
          getting high in my free time. He&apos;s the one who supplied me for
          nearly four years. I just don&apos;t actually know if Leaves would try
          and get me out if I was arrested. He was definitely worried when I ran
          off, but I think that was more about him than about me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, fine. It was definitely more about him. But I don&apos;t think
          he&apos;d want to see over four years of his art go to waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel kinda bad for one of the guards. The other one who seemed to
          know who Leaves is. Kid couldn&apos;t have been older than seventeen
          and looked like a fish out of water. He looked so fucking naive.
          He&apos;s got to be on his Durance, and he seemed new to the job to
          boot. Didn&apos;t seem like he even knew why they were shaking down
          apartments in a relatively quiet part of town. I wonder why they even
          sent him. Didn&apos;t look like he was actually helping the others out
          that much. But I guess that&apos;s good for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole mess made me late to meet Kovach. To be fair, that&apos;s
          kind of on me. I wasn&apos;t confident that Hemlock wasn&apos;t going
          to send some people back to my apartment after I left, so I grabbed my
          ivory and hid it in a box I made out of one of those trashy romance
          novels I bought a while back. Took the box to the vault and tucked it
          at the bottom of a two foot tall stack of books. I don&apos;t think
          there&apos;s any way the guard is going to find it. Going to the
          Vermissian isn&apos;t easy for the uninitiated — they usually
          don&apos;t do well with the whole non-euclidian geometry part. And
          it&apos;s not like I can&apos;t buy more if one of the other Sages
          decides to take it for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got some time to think on the walk over to the Benevolent Order. The
          image of that one guard walking out with the bag of shrooms kept
          coming back into my brain. I guess it&apos;s fortunate for everyone
          that Greeves wasn&apos;t there. I&apos;d hate to be the one to find
          out what they would have done to him. And I realized that means
          sucking up to them in some way. Making myself look like a law abiding,
          upstanding citizen and not just an Aelfir kiss-ass. If I can find out
          anything about those people who moved into Red&apos;s territory, I
          might be able to kill two birds with one stone. But honestly,
          I&apos;ll take just about anything to deflect suspicion from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least Kovach didn&apos;t seem to mind that I was late. Didn&apos;t
          sound like his neighborhood is getting shaken down, but maybe
          it&apos;s just a matter of time. Damn, I really see what
          <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simon meant when he was hinting that the ministry
          would rather have Garris alive. They&apos;re clearly not paying
          Hemlock enough to keep his nose out of places it doesn&apos;t belong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways. Kovach and I went to one of the offices at the Benevolent
          Order, and the clerk pointed us towards the professor for the course
          we found the syllabus for. Theoretical Prayer 102. The professor
          seemed like a piece of work. She was meeting with a student when we
          got there and pointed them towards a night class if they were thinking
          of trying to advance to the 201 level course. Kovach and I waited for
          her to wrap up, and just about all she would tell us was that Garris
          sat in on one of her classes a few weeks back. Apparently she was
          lecturing on the overlap of Aelfir and Drow prayers, which sounded
          kind of interesting until she kept talking.
        </p>
        <p>
          She asked Kovach and I which was more difficult, Divine or Occult
          prayer. I said that from everything I&apos;d gathered, they seemed
          difficult in different ways (and that&apos;s mostly true. I still
          think occult shit is harder because the odds of shit blowing up in
          your face go up dramatically, but I wanted to be diplomatic) and she
          said I was wrong. Kovach said Divine was harder and she said that he
          was right because “you have to ask nicely.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn&apos;t have any words. I still don&apos;t. She went on this
          whole antiquated spiel about how no one knows how to ask for things
          nicely anymore. But whatever. She&apos;s just another entitled
          academic. It&apos;s not like I haven&apos;t dealt with people like her
          before. I&apos;m just not used to directly interacting with them.
          Leaves was always the one who talked to the art snobs when he was
          showing me off. I wasn&apos;t allowed to talk to anyone at his
          exhibits. And if this professor was in any way representative of what
          that would have been like, I&apos;m glad he spared me the trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least she pointed us in the direction of her <abbr>TA</abbr>. There
          was still like half an hour before class started, so Kovach and I
          tried to have a word with him to see if he knew anything else. I say
          tried, because this poor guy was definitely put off by Kovach.
          Wouldn&apos;t say a word until I kicked Kovach out. And I&apos;d be
          lying if I said I couldn&apos;t understand why. I don&apos;t think
          Kovach quite gets how intimidating he can come across.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once I got this guy alone, he was at least willing to open up a
          bit. Not going to name names, on the off chance that someone in
          whatever universe these are getting posted to reads this and finds a
          way back to me just to rat me out. Highly unlikely, but not
          impossible. I don&apos;t want to drag some hapless student who&apos;s
          just up to his eyeballs in debt into any of this mess. He&apos;s been
          working as a
          <abbr>TA</abbr> since he changed majors and he was basically stuck
          there to pay off his loans. He definitely wasn&apos;t looking for
          trouble, and from how anxious he was, I&apos;m thinking he might have
          stumbled into some.
        </p>
        <p>
          He confirmed that Garris was in the class when the professor said he
          was. Dude showed up for a lecture, asked some questions, talked to
          some students, and left. Remember how I mentioned that Garris had a
          sketch of some Drow in a red cloak? Well, I forgot to mention this
          last time, but Kovach had a part of his conspiracy board devoted to
          the red cloaks. It sounds like they&apos;re the people who moved into
          Red&apos;s territory, too. And apparently, Garris thought they had
          some connections to the Benevolent Order.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <abbr>TA</abbr> wouldn&apos;t say much more than that, other than
          that we should come to the night course and we should say that
          we&apos;re enrolled with The Brotherhood. Apparently he told Garris
          the same thing. I don&apos;t actually know what this Brotherhood is.
          If it has anything to do with the Autumn Banquet, I&apos;d hazard a
          guess that they have something to do with some religious sect that
          worships Brother Autumn. Maybe even the Autumn Banquet. There&apos;s
          still several hours to kill between now and the night class, so I got
          the chance to write this out at least. Not sure what I&apos;m going to
          do after I finish this. The smart thing to do would be to try and find
          something I can use to suck up to the guards. Well, maybe. I&apos;ve
          heard very few people speak with the sheer level of vitriol Hemlock
          pulled out when he told me he hoped he didn&apos;t see me at the Guard
          station.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I get a moment, I&apos;ll have a word with Kovach. He has at
          least some knowledge of the criminal underground. He&apos;s got to
          have enough information on someone to get them caught. Or at least,
          he&apos;ll have enough of a lead that I can follow and get the Guard
          off my back. And I guess it wouldn&apos;t hurt to look and see if
          there are any apartments available for rent.
