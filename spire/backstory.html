        <p>
          Faeryn and their family are from <abbr>St.</abbr> Perdita&apos;s
          Circle. Their older sister, Llewellyn, started her durance when Faeryn
          was 13, and Faeryn hasn&apos;t seen her since. They got letters from
          her occasionally until they began their durance at 16.
        </p>
        <h2 id="durance">Durance</h2>
        <p>
          Faeryn&apos;s parents knew that Faeryn stood a chance of being
          conscripted into the army or being sent to the works â€” both situations
          that would likely end in Faeryn&apos;s death. So their parents scraped
          together enough money to bribe the guards who collected Faeryn to hold
          them back long enough that they could dodge the most lethal
          assignments. Instead, Faeryn caught the eye of Leaves-That-Sing, a
          wealthy Aelfir who had originally been looking for a new
          administrative assistant. Leaves saw another use for Faeryn. He
          decided to turn Faeryn into a living work of art by decorating them
          with scarifications. Faeryn&apos;s first scarification was
          excruciating, so for subsequent pieces, they were kept high on Ivory.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first few months of their durance, everything went fine. They
          were given a fair amount of autonomy. They were sent on minor errands,
          and occasionally given small amounts of money to buy themselves
          things. They were obedient when Leaves would take them to social
          events to show off his art.
        </p>
        <p>
          At one of these events, they met Kovach and his master. Kovach&apos;s
          master tried to woo Leaves to climb the social ladder, and Faeryn
          accompanied Leaves to the dueling rings. While there, they overheard
          some interesting tidbits about Kovach before they were left alone with
          Kovach. The two barely spoke. Despite Kovach&apos;s attempts to chat,
          Faeryn was ordered to remain silent. They only gave Kovach curt
          replies, attempting to wrap the conversation up quickly. He
          didn&apos;t get the hint.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, while Faeryn was running errands for Leaves, they found an
          entrance to the Vermissian. They didn&apos;t think anything of it
          until they had to undergo a particularly painful scarification on
          their chest. When they were recovering, they resolved to try and run
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          They took off in the middle of the night and hid in the Vermissian.
          They spent their first night in the abandoned tunnels before traveling
          down the line, trying to make their way down Spire. They didn&apos;t
          have much of a plan and had barely prepared. Leaves&apos; private
          security tracked them down on the second day they were gone. If word
          got out that he had lost his pet, he would have never heard the end of
          the scandal.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they were returned, Faeryn was told in no uncertain terms what
          Leaves could have done to them. Had Faeryn been gone for much longer,
          Leaves would have pulled some strings to have Faeryn legally declared
          dead. And when a living person is declared legally dead in Spire, the
          error is swiftly and brutally corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, Faeryn lost a lot of their limited autonomy. They
          weren&apos;t allowed out of the house unsupervised and were often kept
          leashed in public. Leaves also started training Faeryn to follow basic
          commands: Come, Sit, Freeze, Silence, and Leave. Faeryn has become so
          conditioned to follow his commands that if they are ever unable to
          follow a command, they will panic.
        </p>
        <p>
          About six months later, the public exhibitions began. The first time
          Faeryn was branded in public, they were strapped to a table, drugged
          with sulfur, and had the soles of their feet branded. Sulfur makes the
          user enjoy receiving pain and cruelty, and Faeryn loved the
          experience. That was when Faeryn began to buy into the art project.
          Word of Leave&apos;s project got around, and Faeryn was publicly
          exhibited increasingly often.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the last year of their durance, Leaves allowed
          Faeryn to choose one of the designs for their scarification. In a
          departure from the rest of their geometric pieces, they picked a
          floral design to be carved into their arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of their durance, Leaves offered to continue their
          employment. He would pay them a small stipend to continue being his
          art project, so long as they were available when he requested them.
          Faeryn took the deal because they needed the money and wanted to get
          some autonomy back. They didn&apos;t realize that Leaves saw this as a
          way of extending his control over them. Faeryn was kept just busy
          enough that they were unable to find other work, and they were never
          given enough money to work towards financial independence.
        </p>
        <h2 id="adulthood">Adulthood</h2>
        <p>
          Faeryn spent the first night after their durance in the Vermissian,
          the only place they&apos;d been able to get any reprieve from Leaves
          in years. Shortly after, Faeryn ran into the Vermissian sages and
          began studying under them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faeryn continued to use Ivory after leaving Leaves, to deal with the
          anxiety of being out in the world for the first time. As part of his
          vigilante justice, Kovach killed Faeryn&apos;s dealer, prompting
          Faeryn to track Kovach down and buy the Ivory Kovach had found. Kovach
          and Faeryn became acquaintances after that. Faeryn would tell Kovach
          about their research, and when they were describing the evidence of a
          shadow government conspiracy they had found, Kovach pointed them
          toward the ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faeryn was contacted by the ministry shortly after and studied under a
          sage named Cas. They&apos;re still new to the ministry, and it&apos;s
          only been a year since their durance ended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faeryn has been doing their best to cling to the validation from their
          durance. They&apos;ve done a decent job convincing themselves that
          they aren&apos;t bothered by it, but now and then, the facade cracks.
          Faeryn will show people their scars if they think they&apos;ll get
          validation for them, to help sell themselves on the narrative that
          what happened to them
          <em>wasn&apos;t</em> traumatic.
